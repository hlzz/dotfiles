Subject: CGAL 4.8 Beta 2 Released, Computational Geometry Algorithms Library
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
Body: 

The CGAL Open Source Project is pleased to announce the release 4.8 Beta 2
of CGAL, the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library.

CGAL version 4.8 Beta 2 is a public testing release. It should provide
a solid ground to report bugs that need to be tackled before the
release of the final version of CGAL 4.8 later in March.

That is the second "beta" release for CGAL-4.8. The reason is that there
were important bugs in our CMake scripts for some use cases. See the
details on GitHub:

You can find the detailed description of all changes since CGAL-4.8-beta1
here on GitHub:

As a reminder, you can find below the major changes since CGAL 4.7:

  o General

    - The support for Qt3 is dropped and all demos using it got removed.


  o Installation

    - Starting with Visual C++ 2015 we no longer require Boost.Thread as we
      use the C++11 keyword thread_local and the C+11 class std::mutex.

    - The same holds for g++ 4.8 or later when the C++11 standard is used.


  o Optimal Transportation Curve Reconstruction (new package)

    - This package implements a method to reconstruct and simplify 2D point
      sets.  The input is a set of 2D points with mass attributes, possibly
      hampered by noise and outliers. The output is a set of line segments
      and isolated points which approximate the input points.

  o 3D Mesh Generation
  
    - Add support of 3D gray level images as input for the tetrahedral mesh
      generation.

  o Polygon Mesh Processing

    - Add a new triangle-based isotropic remeshing algorithm for
      triangulated surface meshes.

  o Point Set Processing
  
    - Add Concurrency_tag to the functions compute_average_spacing(),
      edge_aware_upsample_point_set(), jet_estimate_normals(),
      jet_smooth_point_set(), and pca_estimate_normals().

The CGAL project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust,
easy-to-use, and efficient C++ software library of geometric data
structures and algorithms, like
- triangulations (2D constrained triangulations, Delaunay triangulations
  and periodic triangulations in 2D and 3D),
- Voronoi diagrams (for 2D and 3D points, 2D additively weighted
  Voronoi diagrams, and segment Voronoi diagrams),
- Boolean operations on polygons and polyhedra,
- regularized Boolean operations on polygons with curved arcs
- arrangements of curves,
- mesh generation (2D, 3D and surface mesh generation,
  surface mesh subdivision and parametrization),
- alpha shapes (in 2D and 3D),
- convex hull algorithms (in 2D, 3D and dD),
- operations on polygons (straight skeleton and offset polygon),
- search structures (kd trees for nearest neighbor search, and
  range and segment trees),
- interpolation (natural neighbor interpolation and placement of
  streamlines),
- optimization algorithms (smallest enclosing sphere of points or
  spheres, smallest enclosing ellipsoid of points, principal
  component analysis),
- kinetic data structures
