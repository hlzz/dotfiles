This project records my configuration files, including bash configurations, text editor configurations, etc. Since I broke my OS quite often, this project serves as a quick recovery. If you find this repository useful, please star it to let me know. :)

Install
----------------
In the top-level directory, run the following command in the terminal:

    ./install.sh

This will do the following things:  
1. update vim setttings  
2. install CMake 3.5.1  
3. (If QtCreator has been installed) After installing qt creator, put monokai.xml in ~/.config/QtProject/qtcreator/styles/ and select scheme in Text Editor preferences.
